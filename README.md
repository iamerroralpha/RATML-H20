## When we will no longer have water
Have you ever wondered what would you do if a given, common resource is no longer available to you? Well, let us put a simple example:

### Gasoline

Something that has already been scarce in various parts of the world, and is happening more frequently with this and other hydrocartbons around the world, as some productive chains have been disrupted.

**If we do not have access to gasoline** it will not be the end of the world, we could just stop using the car, or stoppingg any activities involcing this commodity...

But what would it happen if we run out of

### Water

The most vital liquid for humans, that is taken for granted... Until it is not. Let us just look back at the water crysis the northern states of Mexico lived a couple months ago. Talking about the water crysis is a complex matter, so we will limit ourselves to observe data in order to help formulate our hypothesis:

#### Usage trends

##### How much water do we use?
Although the OECD no longer shows an exponential increase regarding water usage, the compound effect of the BRICS and the Rest Of the World countries show an exponential growth in demand.

The following chart shows us how does this trend looks groraphically:

##### Our scope: Mexico City

To limit the scope of our problem, we will use Mexico City, as it is a great example of how **NOT** to treat such an important resource. Here are some hard facts:

###### Less than 50% of mexicans have access to a safely managed water service

###### Shameful comparison with the best performing countries...

###### You cant drink tap water: known fact

###### Cutzamala system leaks more than 35% of the water it delivers

###### Mexico City alone demanded 600 hm3 of water in 2018


# Research questions:
- How much waste water does the city provide?
	- Mass is not created nor destroyed, so the water demand will be considered the waste supplied.
- How would our proposal affect the water cycle?
	- From the standpoint of virtuous cycles (more)
- How to take advantage of the byproducts of the treatment process?
- How would an optimization process look alike?
	- Define inputs and outputs of the simmulation (estimated water input and quality, efficiency of the sub processes, outputs (clean water and byproducts)), and the physical process (polluted water -> clean water)
- How many treatment plants would we need to satisfy MxCTY?
